# Watch10
Watch Application using aspects of HealthKit- Kilometers ran, calories burnt, and beats/minute.
Lessons learned - HealthKit, Query, Predicates, upDateHandler(), Saving, Buttons, HealthStore, HKWorkActivityType, enums, Sets
This Application utilises HealthKit and instead of the user seeing everything on his watch as per the application that is shipped
with the watch, the user can just look at one aspect of his workout. ie. how many calaries he/she is burning, or how many kilometers
he/she has done. Sometimes simplicity on the watch is easier on the eye of the user who is concentrating on only one aspect of his/her
workout. I hopefully will be added more fuctionality and graphics to this app in the future.
